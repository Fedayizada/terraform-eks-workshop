In this challenge you will deploy a sample application using CodeCommit, CodePipeline & CodeBuild

```bash
cd ~/environment/tfekscode/sampleapp
```

Create a service credential to use with our CodeCommit git repo:

```bash
usercred=$(aws iam create-service-specific-credential --user-name git-user --service-name codecommit.amazonaws.com)
GIT_USERNAME=$(echo $usercred | jq -r '.ServiceSpecificCredential.ServiceUserName')
GIT_PASSWORD=$(echo $usercred | jq -r '.ServiceSpecificCredential.ServicePassword')
CREDENTIAL_ID=$(echo $usercred| jq -r '.ServiceSpecificCredential.ServiceSpecificCredentialId')
test -n "$GIT_USERNAME" && echo GIT_USERNAME is "$GIT_USERNAME" || "echo GIT_USERNAME is not set"

```

Clone the (empty) repo:

```bash
test -n "$AWS_REGION" && echo AWS_REGION is "$AWS_REGION" || "echo AWS_REGION is not set"
git clone codecommit::$AWS_REGION://eksworkshop-app
```

{{< output >}}
Cloning into 'eksworkshop-app'...

'Namespace' object has no attribute 'cli_binary_format'
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
{{< /output >}}

---

Populate with our source files - including the special file **buildspec.yaml** which has the steps CodeBuild will follow.



```bash
cd eksworkshop-app
cp ../buildspec.yml .
cp ../*.tf .
```

Add files, commit and push
```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit."
git push
```
---

This should now trigger a few activities

Check you can see your code in CodeCommit - navigate to your repository in the console and confirm you can see the files:

Next check if the CodePipeline is running - navigate to it in the console

You can also link through to the CodeBuild project:

And tail to logs of the build job (scroll the window or use the `Tail Logs` button):

Check everything is running ?


```
kubectl get pods,svc,deployment -n game-2048 -o wide
```
```

```

Note that

* The pods are depoyed to a 110.64 address
* The service is exposing port 80
* The deployment is referencing a private ECR repository beonging to your account




Enable port forwarding so we can see the application in out Cloud9 IDE

```
kubectl port-forward service/service-2048 8080:80 -n game-2048
```
```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 80
Handling connection for 8080
Handling connection for 8080
Handling connection for 8080

```

Preview the running (port-forwarded service) application from the cloud 9 IDE

Preview -> Preview Running Application
![tf-state](/images/andyt/game-2048-0.jpg)

You should then see the app running in the browser

----


Check the Load Balancer & Ingress in the same way as described in the previous section.

----


##Â Cleanup

Interrupt the port forwarding with ctrl-c if necessary.


```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
